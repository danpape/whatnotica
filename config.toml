All of the work is made from vintage papers hand cut with love and a need to make sense of whatever we have done to women and animals. I can explain each element (intent and sustainability are kinda my thing). Please contact me if you are interested in wholesale or just want to talk about where I found an opium smoker in a kids book--I live vintage. Thank you so much for supporting me and my process.
