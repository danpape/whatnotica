From cakes to casseroles to all the meat things in between (carpaccio?). what better way than a button to spread these words- all of them like a nice old cookbook repurposed into a timely message of mutual survival. Sharpie buttons are all one of a kind salvaged from my collection of vintage cake books (I was going through a phase). Please let me know if i you have a specific food type you are looking for, otherwise I will just pick one that seems like it's nice:).  Buttons are approximately two and a half delicious inches across. Have a beautiful day and please,  stay human.
