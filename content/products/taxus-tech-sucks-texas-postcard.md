I went to school for advertising in Texas for some reason. I was a vegetarian, didn't lead to a career in selling. The original uses all propaganda from farm magazines of the era, as well we the US Agricultural photo series, built on original vintage papers using the women we were given. So much to see here, exploitation wise.
