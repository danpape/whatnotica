Grooming, emotional abuse, neglect, narcissism-surviving the ignorance of the 80s was draining and inspirational. This is not a card, it's a "meme" book i wrote 25 years ago before I knew what a meme was using early internet images and their backstory. The photos show the imperfections of a plastic world. This was before the homogenization of ebay and the internet when humans created the standards for commerce. Personality disorders are difficult for kids to process and this book was for the cluster Bees in my life. The book reflects a life time of shadow work and the light between. Bullies suck and love over rules.
